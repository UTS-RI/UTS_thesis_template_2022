  *  Original by Gavin Paul, Phillip Quin and Lakshitha Dantanarayana.
  *  Modified by Fred Sukkar.
  * Further refined by Victor Hernandez Moreno.
    * Change log:
      * Declaration of Authorship Changed to the new version required by GRS
      * Title commands are now in the main tex file not the class file
      *  New UTS logo added.
      *  Title page changed to new version required by GRS

(Official UTS logo guidelines dictate the logo should be where it is. Do not change position. Furthermore, the logo can only be used when the thesis is officially accepted by the university i.e. Final version. You might have to remove it if you plan to make intermediate versions public. E.g. In your website. Please check UTS policies.)
